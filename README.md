Synopsis

This project is dedicated to simplifying Solid State Devices Course calculation.

Based on HTML and CSS user interface, user can easily compute most of the P-N junction, MOS capacitor and MOSFET common values. 


====================

PN Junction:

Diffusivity, Electric Field, Built-in potential, Current Density, Resistivity, Xp,Xn,Xd, Capacitance. 

=====

MOS capacitor:

Faltband Voltage, Threshold Voltage,  Xd0, Xd, Cox, Cb, Cdtotoal.

=====

MOSFET:

Region of Operation, Id, Output Conductance.

=====

PN Diode:

Built-in Potential, Lp, Ln, Xp, Xn, Xd, Cj0, Cj, Cd, I0, Id, gd, transit Time.

=====

Uni Converter:

cm <-> mm <-> nm

=====

Mobility Curve is attached at the end. 


====================

NOTE:

Samples are at 300K in the dark, assuming the depletion approximation for p-n junctions, and the inversion approximation for MOS capacitors.All raw data can be found in console.
